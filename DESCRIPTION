Description: Segmentation and classification procedures for data from the 'Activinsights GENEActiv' <https://activinsights.com/technology/geneactiv/> accelerometer that provides the user with a model to guess behaviour from test data where behaviour is missing.
    Includes a step counting algorithm, a function to create segmented data with custom features and a function to use recursive partitioning provided in the function rpart() of the 'rpart' package to create classification models.
